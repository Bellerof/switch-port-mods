**The 60fps mod work for all regions and updates available** without having to make a specific mod for each region or having to update the mod. 

**EXCEPTION:** The Unlock 60fps Limit mod has to be updated.

### **What does Unlock 60fps Limit do?**: 

Disables the in engine 64 FPS lock when FPS is unlocked by pressing Control U (Yuzu) or F1 (Ryujinx) on your keyboard or when you set Vsync OFF/Disabled in your emulator settings.

### Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.

In case you want to use Unlock 60fps Limit make sure that you're using the correct version for your update.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips and install the mods. **Keep in mind that I don't suggest use Uncap FPS Mod on Switch or SteamDeck.**

**Finally:** If there's no Unlock 60fps Limit mod update available for your region click on the TID links and replace the @nsobid numbers + letters on the .pchtxt file with the Build ID's of your region. Grab all numbers + letters until you reach the 0's. In total they are 32 digits. Ex: 2058227F80E9B40C3B51DB95CAF6B206

If Tinfoil doesn't update and doesn't have the latest Build ID: You can extract it using [this method](https://youtu.be/d1XWoEgAgrU)
