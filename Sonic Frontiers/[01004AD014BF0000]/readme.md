This mod is not mine. It was made by [systemdev](https://gbatemp.net/threads/sonic-frontiers-1-1-1-60fps-exefs-patch.625595/) and updated by the GBATemp community.

Instructions:

1. Click on the 60fps folder. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.4.1.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch)
