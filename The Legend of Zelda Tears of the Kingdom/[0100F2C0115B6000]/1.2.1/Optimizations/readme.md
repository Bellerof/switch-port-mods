### Shaders:

There are always a lot of people arguing about this topic. I sincerely recommend you to **ignore these comments and try things for yourselves**.

In my personal tests, sharing shaders doesn't work as you might expect. You may get the feeling that it's working but I would say it's a bit more placebo. Here are 2 tests I did using shaders shared by other users. Judge for yourselves.

- [Test 1](https://youtu.be/JypO8UBHApk?si=AYgdoCwmF9aGoLxA)
- [Test 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3x4ZfvptlM)

**How to test this**: Simple. Get an overlay to see your stats ([MSI Afterburner + RivaTurner for instance](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards)) and record a gameplay using OBS. Record 1 gameplay using your own shaders and record another one using shared shaders and do comparisons. Then do the same using cleaning shaders vs shared shaders. Finally record another one using clean shaders vs your previous built shaders.

Once you have all the gameplays recorded, make your notes, compare gameplays, take notes about if FPS were stable and better or not, if you noticed stuttering etc etc and finally draw your conclusions.

My personal opinion is that it's not worth it. Despite this there will always be people who say that sharing shaders works.

These shared shaders are built on another PC with totally different specs than yours and on a version of the game that is probably not the one you are using.

Also when you update the game and change version or when you want to move from a newer update to an older one, I would always advise to clean the shaders and rebuild them.

Finally always clean your shaders if you notice any stuttering. This might help.

### Drivers:

A Yuzu developer discovered that the **545.84 Nvidia Drivers solves low VRAM stability** so you might want to give them a try.

Anyway, always keep your drivers up to date. For some older graphics cards it may be recommended to use older drivers but these are very specific and special cases. I have no idea about AMD but I recommend using the most up to date ones as well. I'm not a fan of AMD GPUs and their software.

Finally go to your Nvidia Control Panel Settings and set this (sorry for the Spanish Translation):

Most people have this option on: Let the app decide and IMO this is a mistake.

### Remove Background Tasks:

**I'm not responsible for any misuse of the following recommendations**.

Sometimes we have apps running in the background that we don't need. I recommend using Task Manager and checking that we don't have things we don't need running in the background.

One program I recommend is [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns). Run it as Administrator. Then click on Logon and untick everything you don't use except: cmd.exe and any n/a box.

Do the same for Services and maybe Scheduled Task. Search on Google what you should untick. This will avoid these apps running at the background when you boot Windows. Also try to avoid bloatware (search on Google if you don't know what bloatware is).

Finally I did my PC optimizations using some videos from [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FR33THY/videos) so maybe you want to check it out.

### End of the guide:

That's all. I think this is all you'll need to know about setup Yuzu, settings, mods and possible optimizations.
