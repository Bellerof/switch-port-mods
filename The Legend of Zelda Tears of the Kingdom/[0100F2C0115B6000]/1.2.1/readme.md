**09/23/2023 Update:**

I have seen a lot of people using these mods especially the *'60fps Static Mod'* and thinking they are going to have a 60fps performance as if it was DFPS ... You are wrong. This mod will slow down your game when the 60fps is not stable: so no, it will not give you the same performance as DFPS.

My advice is to stay on 1.2.0 and use [DFPS 1.5.5](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/comments/14xksce/beta1_totk_dynamicfps_v155beta1_custom_internal/) or the alternative version [(DFPS++) by MaxLastBreath](https://github.com/MaxLastBreath/TOTK-DFPS).

IMO: I don't see a necessary reason to update to 1.2.1 (see patch notes [here](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/61936/kw/tears%20of%20the%20kingdom/p/989#v121)) so if you don't want to update and if I were you I would stay on 1.2.0 or lower (except 1.0.0 due to a bug in the death screen) and use DFPS 1.5.5.

Btw New Sky Island Fix is actually only for **2x Resolution**. If you play on higher res [take a look at this](https://github.com/HolographicWings/TOTK-Mods-collection/tree/main/Mods/Graphics) and get yours.

Simply open the Visual Improvements folder, then open exefs folder and then edit the main-1.2.1.pchtxt file, find New Sky Island Fix and replace it with the one that matches your resolution.

Finally I recommend you to visit this [TOTK-Mods-collection](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/tree/main) to find other updated mods as well as [their guide](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/blob/main/SETUP.md) to know how to setup your Yuzu settings for TOTK.
