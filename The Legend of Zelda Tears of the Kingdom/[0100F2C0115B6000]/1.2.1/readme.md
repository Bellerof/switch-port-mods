### TOTK 1.2.1 November 2023 Update:

**DISCLAIMER**: If you don't understand something because you don't know English, translate the information using [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/). It's a better translator compared to Google. Also keep in mind that I don't offer official support to solve your problems and I'm not a Yuzu developer. There are many people who think that by making a guide I must solve all your problems. This guide is totally voluntary. Remember to read [MaxLastBreath TOTK's Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxlastbreath/comments/148o725/tears_of_the_kingdom_yuzu_setup_guide_60_fps_up/) as well as [MaxLastBreath's Bugs Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxlastbreath/comments/148p4wh/yuzu_totk_bugmegathread/) instead.

### Context:

Some people have asked me to make a video of my settings for TOTK 1.2.1. To be honest I haven't played TOTK since the 1.2.0 update and [Chuck's last DFPS update (1.5.5)](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/comments/14xksce/beta1_totk_dynamicfps_v155beta1_custom_internal/) and my last contribution to TOTK was to update the mods to 1.2.1 the same day the update was released in the hope that Chuck would adapt DFPS 1.5.5 at the same time or in later days (this in the end was not the case). 

So after all this time I have put TOTK aside. I have been focusing on other games, learning more about how to mod and [making new mods](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods) so all the info that I will give you will be based on what I remember and what I have been learning these days to make this update.

Chuck has been missing for several months and never got around to updating DFPS 1.5.5 to TOTK's 1.2.1 update. This is his [last Reddit message](https://www.reddit.com/u/ChucksFeedAndSeed/comments/14xksce/comment/ju8qqth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

His last mod was DFPS 1.5.5 beta7 (I don't know if there were more betas besides this one) but some people talk about this being the last one. Very few people had access to this beta so itâ€™s unknown what changes Chuck made until now.

A very nice and friendly user shared this beta with me and I'm attaching it to this November 2023 Update so that you can try it out and make your own comparisons.

Also, during this time, [MaxLastBreath](https://github.com/MaxLastBreath/TOTK-DFPS) has been dedicated to replicating what was DFPS++ (a mod that came out around the same time as Chuck's early versions of DFPS) but stopped being updated. He has also tried to improve it and adapt it to something closer to DFPS 1.5.5. He still has things to improve and adapt but during my tests his work is more than sufficient. Also the Max's mod is compatible with the 1.2.1 update. Here's an [old comparison between these mods](https://youtu.be/5zMMAq4hfsQ?si=fsD9EuvXXW7IjX4B). 

For people who don't know him (although I imagine you already know him) he is the person who made the [TOTK megathread](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxlastbreath/comments/148o725/tears_of_the_kingdom_yuzu_setup_guide_60_fps_up/) as well as [the one about bugs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Maxlastbreath/comments/148p4wh/yuzu_totk_bugmegathread/). 

Eventually some modders have been disappearing and nowadays few people except Max have been dedicated to TOTK. Apart from this, I recommend you to visit this [TOTK-Mods-collection](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/tree/main) to find other updated mods as well as [their guide](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/blob/main/SETUP.md) to know how to setup your Yuzu settings for TOTK. 

My settings are based on this guide with some changes to adapt my settings to my taste. 

### Guide stars here:

Let's start by [downloading Yuzu](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom/%5B0100F2C0115B6000%5D/1.2.1/How%20to%20Setup%20Yuzu) and [changing some settings](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom/%5B0100F2C0115B6000%5D/1.2.1/Settings%20(Only%20for%20Yuzu)). We will end with some [optimizations info](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom/%5B0100F2C0115B6000%5D/1.2.1/Optimizations) that you might need to know.

**I won't do a Ryujinx Guide** due to the game has always worked poorly for me using Ryujinx.
