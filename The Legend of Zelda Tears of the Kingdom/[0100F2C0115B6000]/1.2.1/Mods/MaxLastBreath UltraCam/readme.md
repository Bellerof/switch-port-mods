### MaxLastBreath README.TXT:

Please open the RomFS folder and then go to the DFPS folder and **open the maxlastbreath.ini config file** using NotePad or [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

I suggest use NotePad++. We will edit the .ini file to setup the mod based on your desired outcome.

Most importantly make sure you match your emulator's upscaling settings to the upscaling settings inside of the config file.

DON'T USE THIS MOD WITH OTHER DFPS MODS, IT MAY BREAK THINGS!. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

WARNING!

FOR KEYBOARD ENABLE VIRTUAL KEYBOARD IN YUZU/RYUJINX.

Ryujinx needs to be installed in ATMOSPHERE FOLDER or keyboard won't work.

### Things that you need to know to modify the .ini file:

`MaxFrameRate`: Here you can indicate whether you want your MaxFrameRate to be: 20, 30 or 60. If your PC is unable to exceed 30fps, leave it at 30. If you don't reach 30 stable try leaving it at 20. Set 60fps if your frames are between 35-50fps. **Keep in mind that even the most powerful CPU can't handle 60fps stable**. This is a game that requires a good high CPU (above 8 cores) for good performance.

`Fov`: You can edit this and set it to your liking. I leave it as default.

`ResolutionScale`: This section is important. If you use 0 it will Disable all Resolution Quality Optimization. So if your PC can't handle 1080p Docked & 720p Handheld and you try to decrease it and set 0, it won't work. Keep that in mind.

**How Emu Resolution  Scale works**:

I'm using 2X (1440p/2160p). So that will be 1440p on Handheld mode and 2160p on Docked Mode. 

To use this mod you cannot use resolutions lower than 1x. Also don't use 1.5x because it's buggy. So if you're using 1x here, set the ResolutionScale to 1.0. If you're using 2X, set 2.0, 3X set 3.0 etc etc.

`ShadowResolution`: I'm using 1024. You can use 512 if you're having issues. Decrease it to 206 if 512 and 1024 doesn't work properly for you although I'd use 512 or 1024. I won't go higher.

`DisableFog`: This is personal preference. You like FOG?: Keep it (false). You don't like FOG: Disable it (true).
