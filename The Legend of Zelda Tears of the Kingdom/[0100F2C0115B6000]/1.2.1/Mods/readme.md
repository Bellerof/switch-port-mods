Remember to also watch the Optimizations folder.

These are the new mods that I'm using in my November 2023 post update.

These mods are divided into 3 folders:

- **ChucksFeedAndSeed DFPS 1.5.5**: This folder contains DFPS 1.5.5 mod created by [ChucksFeedAndSeed](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/submitted/). Inside you will find beta3 and beta7. Very few people have this last beta (beta7) so it's unknown what bugs it may have. Try it for yourself, make comparisons and draw your own conclusions. 

- **NEW November 2023 Update Personal Mods**: This folder contains the New Mod Pack that I'm using to make this November 2023 Guide. [UltraCam by MaxLastBreath](https://gamebanana.com/mods/480138) is missing (I'm not including it in case he makes updates in his Gamebanana post so download it from his post).

- **OLD Personal Zelda TOTK 1.2.1 Mods**: This folder contains the old mods that I updated when the 1.2.1 update was released. I'm not currently using these mods but I have included them in case anyone wants or needs them in the future.

Additionally I have added a folder called **MaxLastBreath UltraCam**, the **main mod** that I'm using where I make some notes to keep in mind when using this mod. **You should check this folder**.

Finally you have the [TOTK-Mods-Collection](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/tree/main) where you can find other mods and if you need cheats updated to 1.2.1 [check this post](https://github.com/bad1dea/NXCheats/pull/143/files#diff-297a7a079b7022e482c041464258903777f84db6b70640e2b47a78fe1b23e2bd)

### About Chuck's Mods:

I higly suggest you read the .ini file inside ```DynamicFPS - #1-0 - v1.5.5 (Required)``` folder. Open the RomFS folder and then dfps folder. You'll see `default.ini`. You should read this file to know what the mod is doing, adding and how to setup the mod. Also read every .txt file that you find.

### How to download them:

Open the folder that you want to use. Ex: NEW November 2023 Update Personal Mods. Then click on the .zip file Ex: `New Zelda TOTK 1.2.1 Mods Pack.zip` finally click on `View raw`

### How to install them:

1. Open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
2. Open the downloaded .zip file
3. Select the mods that you want to use and drag the mods into your Mod Data Location/Mods Directory.

### My Final TOTK 1.2.1 November 2023 Update Mods:

### What I'm using:

- **Black Screen Fix**: This mod is required if your FPS are above 30. When you are changing weapons, shields or bows etc etc the screen will go black. This mod fixes it. If you are using a mod UI (Xbox UI, PS4 UI, SteamDeck UI etc etc) that already includes this mod, don't use this and don't duplicate it. Just use the UI mod instead.

- **Increased Camera Speed**: I think the Original Camera Speed is too low for my taste so this mod improves the camera speed. I edited the original values of this mod due to I also think that the original mod is too slow.

- **UltraCam 1.0.1**: Just MaxLastBreath's mod. Remember to check his Gamebanana and the MaxLastBreath UltraCam folder for more info about this.

- **Visual Improvements**: Here I only have Remove DOF when targeting and LensFlare Removal. Personal preference. Disable it if you don't like it. The rest of Visual Improvements like LOD, FXAA etc etc are not longer needed (some of them are already included in Max's UltraCam Mod).

### Optimizations:

Finally we will end the guide with the optimizations that I suggest to keep in mind.
