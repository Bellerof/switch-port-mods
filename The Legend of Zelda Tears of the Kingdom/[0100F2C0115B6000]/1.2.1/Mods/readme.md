Remember to also watch the Optimizations folder.

**March 2024 Mods (USE THIS INSTEAD THE OLD STUFF)** folder are the new mods that I'm using in my **March 2024 post** update.

The mods that you find in this section are divided into 2 folders:

- **March 2024 Mods (USE THIS INSTEAD THE OLD STUFF)**: This folder contains the latest UltraCam Mod by MaxLastBreath and this is the only mod that I suggest to use at the time of updating this guide (03/10/2024).

- **November 2023 Mods (OLD STUFF. DON'T USE IT IN 2024)**: This folder contains the old pack that I was using in the November 2023 Guide. 

>[!TIP]
Another interesting mod could be **Native 4K/2K by KeatonTheBot**. Find all info about this mod [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/482729)

Finally if you need cheats updated to 1.2.1 [check this post](https://github.com/bad1dea/NXCheats/pull/143/files#diff-297a7a079b7022e482c041464258903777f84db6b70640e2b47a78fe1b23e2bd)

## About ChucksFeedAndSeed's Mods

Forget about ChucksFeedAndSeed and his DynamicFPS 1.5.5 (and all the betas he had as well as older versions of DynamicFPS), **those mods are quite outdated, laggy and give a lot of stutters compared to UltraCam 2.0** and MaxLastBreath's work is more current and better optimized.

So if you're a "YouTuber" and you like clickbaits to gain views and rename your videos with (UPDATED TO 2024), stop, you're using old stuff and your viewers are not getting really up-to-date content + the best perfomance possible.

## How to download these mods

Open the `March 2024 Mods (USE THIS INSTEAD THE OLD STUFF)` folder. Then click on the .zip file and finally click on `View raw`

## How to install them

1. Open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
2. Open the downloaded .zip file
3. Select the mods that you want to use and drag the mods into your Mod Data Location/Mods Directory.

## Optimizations

Finally we will end the guide with the [optimizations](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom/%5B0100F2C0115B6000%5D/1.2.1/Optimizations) that I suggest to keep in mind.
