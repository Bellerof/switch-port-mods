This is my personal settings and you should not use it as is, as my PC is totally different from yours and you may have a worse performance.

For instance: I'm using a 4K resolution (3840x2160) and maybe your PC is not powerful enough to use this resolution. Sometimes I change it to 1440p (2560x1440) if I don't have a good perfomance.

Same for the FPS, I'm using MaxFramerate set at 60 as well as the ShadowResolution set at 1024 so if you are having problems with this, you should change it.

I also like to have a fairly high camera sensitivity and you may not adapt to it, so I suggest you change it or readapt it to your liking.

You can change the camera speed in the `Gameplay` section. I've mine set on Stick_Vertical_Speed = 1.5 + Stick_Horizontal_Speed = 3.0

>[!IMPORTANT]
Don't change this: EmuScale = 1.0. EmuScale must be set on 1.0.

>[!TIP]
I would leave the **Triple Buffer option** ON and only turn it OFF if you are having issues/is not working properly or as expected. **DON'T SET THIS ON** if you're a Switch user.

TripleBuffer ON for some reason is causing issues if you are a Switch user and not an emulator user.

Double buffer means that when the game can't maintain 60 FPS it drops to 30 FPS. 

Triple Buffer helps with this and tries to prevent this from happening.
