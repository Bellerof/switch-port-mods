**Game Title**: Luigi's Mansion 2 HD

**TitleID: 010048701995E000**

> [!NOTE]
You can disable/turn OFF Vsync or press Control U (for Yuzu + forks) or F1 (for Ryujinx) and set a FPS limit using RivaTuner or alternative **instead**.

In addition if you use Yuzu and the forks, you can set the limit speed percent to 200 % and get 60FPS. If you set 400 % you will get 120FPS etc etc.

The 60FPS mod I've made is intended for people who don't want or can't use these options.

## Versions compatible 

- 1.0.0 (BuildID: A71EC0B9FF4F54CB)

## Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and `Open Mod Data Location` (Yuzu)/`Open Mods Directory` (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.0.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
