> [!NOTE]
You can disable/turn OFF Vsync or press Control U (for Yuzu + forks) or F1 (for Ryujinx) and set a FPS limit using RivaTuner or another alternative **instead**.

In addition if you use Yuzu and the forks, you can set the limit speed percent to 200 % and get 60FPS. If you set 400 % you will get 120FPS etc etc.

These mods I've made are intended for people who don't want or can't use these options..

## Versions compatible 

- 1.0.0 (BuildID: A71EC0B9FF4F54CB)

Although it should still work in future updates (I'm not sure. I would have to check it).

## FPS Mods Options Available:

- 60FPS (Set a limit of 60FPS).

- FPS Unlocked (Allows to play above 60FPS). On my testings: If I use Yuzu the max FPS with this mod is 120. If I use Ryujinx it can be above that.

## Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and `Open Mod Data Location` (Yuzu)/`Open Mods Directory` (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.0.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

**Download the .ips file instead** and extract it into the **root of your SD card**. Keep in mind that **you might need OC**

Seems [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) is not working this time. 

Status Monitor doesn't work either, so you cannot check the FPS and will have to rely on your own feelings.

I guess there will be an update to fix this.

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
