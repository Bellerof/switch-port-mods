This mod has probably been the most difficult mod I have tried to make but it has helped me to learn several things about Unreal Engine 4.

The mod was almost done, I just had to fix the game speed (the game would speed up when you unlocked 60fps). Fixing the speed of the game is not a simple task and is what has taken me days and weeks to try to figure out.

Fl4sh_ decided to accept the challenge too and help me to achieve it and after several days and weeks of testing we finally succeeded.

I also want to thank Masagrator and Hazerou + ChanseyIsTheBest for the information provided in order to make and better understand the mod.

Finally I also want to thank JAGSTAX for providing me with some files to further understand how the cheat worked on real hardware. This has been quite key to make the mod.

## FPS Options

- 60fps
- 120fps
- 144fps

## NOTES FOR RYUJINX users**

**Don't use the 144fps mod. The game will slowdown.** 

Use the 120fps mod option **(this will uncap FPS on Ryujinx)** instead and cap/limit your FPS using RivaTuner.

**Don't use the 2160p Resolution Mod**. Ryujinx seems that can't handle it properly and the FPS will drop + game will slowdown.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.0.0.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
