**On 03/23/2024 we found an issue regarding The Case of the Rainy-Day Plot Stage** so I have replaced the previous 60FPS + Uncap FPS mods. 

Below you will find **Ryujinx instructions only** on how to use this mod and how to fix the issue.

Remember that the game in other emulators doesn't work properly and has crashes. However, these same instructions can be applied to these emulators.

## Ryujinx Instructions

Once you have downloaded the mod and extracted it into the corresponding mod directory, you will do the following:

1. Right click on the game and then click on Manage Mods. Check that you have enabled the mods as shown in the following screenshot:

Once this check is done, click on Save.

2. Again, right click on the game and then click on Manage Cheats. Check that you have enabled the cheats as shown in the following screenshot:

Once this check is done, click on Save.

Now, go to your mods directory folder. You will find that a new folder called cheats has been created. Inside you will find a file called enabled.txt.

If you open it, you will know which cheats you have enabled.

3. When you find a softlock like the one that occurs in The Case of the Rainy-Day Plot you will do the following: 

- **Press ZL + Dpad Down** while the softlock happens. Here's a [picture of this combination for dummies](https://i.imgur.com/DNJWvIE.png)

This will cause the FPS to drop for a few seconds while holding down the combination. Once the softlock is solved, stop pressing the combination and continue playing as you normally would.

## Alternative to ZL + Dpad Down

You can **use RivaTuner** to cap the FPS to 30 and then remove the cap.
