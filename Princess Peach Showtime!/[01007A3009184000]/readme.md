>[!CAUTION]
**4K Mod is not working properly on Ryujinx, so it's better to use 2K Mod instead.**

**This is not a problem caused by the mod**. It's a Ryujinx issue. 

Ryujinx has issues with 4K Mods making the perfomance really bad (crashes, freezes, slowdowns, fps drops ...).

The only fix for now it's that if you have enough knowledge to build Ryujinx, do a custom build for yourself and increase the texture cache total size limit.

[Here's the PR + info](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/pull/6471#issue-2182256298) about the texture cache total size limit

## Instructions

>[!TIP]
Unlike using Control U/F1 or just disabling Vsync, these mods fix cutscenes locked at 24fps and allows you to play the game at 30/60/Uncap FPS with cutscenes fix included.

>[!NOTE]
30fps + Uncap FPS are .zip files, so **just click on the .zip file and then click on View Raw** to start the download, then unzip the files into your mods directory and that's all.

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
