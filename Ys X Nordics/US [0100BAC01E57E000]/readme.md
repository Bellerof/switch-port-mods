**TitleID: 0100BAC01E57E000**

If you're going to play on emulator **use Ryujinx or Sudachi**

## Emulator Instructions

**[VIDEO TUTORIAL HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5fLfaZAWc)**

1. **Click on the folder of the version that you want to use**

Example: I would click on the 1.0.1 folder in this example.

Then **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**. 

Example: I would click on the Disable DOF-BLUR mod folder.

**Now click on the .pchtxt file.**

Finally move your mouse over the arrow icon and **click on it (Download Raw file)** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be similar to this: `Disable DOF\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt files to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
