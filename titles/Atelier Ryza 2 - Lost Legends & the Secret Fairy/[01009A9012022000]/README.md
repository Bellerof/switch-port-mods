**Mod requested by Eruca** on Discord.

>[!NOTE]
I only tested this game using the US Version.

The TID for US version is: 01009A9012022000.

>[!CAUTION] 
**Unfortunately, this mod won't work for all updates available**. Only Base Game + update v.1.0.7. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
Also **I don't know if it will work on other region**.

>[!TIP]
Alternatively you can use Control U (Yuzu) or F1 (Ryujinx) to unlock the FPS and use the Nvidia/AMD Control Panel to limit the FPS to 60. 

**In Yuzu you could also [set the speed limiter to 200 %](https://i.imgur.com/L9EIkiP.png)**.

To do this `right click on the game`, then click on `Properties`. 

Then click on `System` and finally in the `Limit Speed Percent` section set it to 200 %.

**Instructions:**

1. Click on the `60fps` folder. Then click on the .pchtxt file of the update that you're going to use and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.0.7.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
