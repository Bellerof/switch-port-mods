Most of these mods are no longer needed as they have been improved and incorporated into DFPS 1.5.5. You can follow the mod thread at this [link](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/comments/14xksce/beta1_totk_dynamicfps_v155beta1_custom_internal/).

I also recommend you to check the [creator's Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/submitted/) for future updates.

Finally I recommend you to visit this [TOTK-Mods-collection](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/tree/main) to find other updated mods as well as [their guide](https://github.com/hoverbike1/TOTK-Mods-collection/blob/main/SETUP.md) to know how to setup your Yuzu settings for TOTK.
