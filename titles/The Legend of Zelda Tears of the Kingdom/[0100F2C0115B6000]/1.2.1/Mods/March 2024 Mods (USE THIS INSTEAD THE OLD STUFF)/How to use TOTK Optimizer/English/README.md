## Download TOTK Optmizer

[TOTK Optimizer can be found here](https://github.com/MaxLastBreath/TOTK-mods/releases). However, you may only want to get UltraCam.

## TOTK Optimizer Setup

**TOTK Optimizer is not a virus or trojan**. The message appears because TOTK Optimizer is not a Microsoft's paid license app (paying for a license costs a lot).

Because of this, Windows Defender or any other antivirus detects it as a virus or trojan and can delete TOTK Optimizer from your PC.

To avoid this, disable the antivirus for a moment and enable it again when you have finished using TOTK Optimizer.

The first time that you launch TOTK-Optimizer you might see this screen:

Just click "More Info" and then click "Run anyway". 

So ... this is TOTK Optimizer's UI:

Here, just select the options that you want to use. If you hover your mouse over the names you will see a short description of what each setting does.

**Don't forget to click on Advanced too**. You will find more settings there such as:

Finally, when you are finished you have two options:

- Click on Apply or

- Click on Extract.

Apply Option will setup everything for you, so you just have to open the emulator, be sure the mod files appears and are enabled and just run the game.

Extract option will make a TOTK Optimizer folder with UltraCam's files inside, so you will have to copy this folder and paste it into your mods directory.

Just choose the option you like the most and that's all.

Remember that you have a more detailed description of the settings [HERE](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom/%5B0100F2C0115B6000%5D/1.2.1/Mods/March%202024%20Mods%20(USE%20THIS%20INSTEAD%20THE%20OLD%20STUFF)/UltraCam%20Settings%20-%20Full%20Detailed%20Options/English)
