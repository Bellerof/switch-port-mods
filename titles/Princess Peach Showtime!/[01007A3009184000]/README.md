>[!NOTE]
**On 03/23/2024 we found an issue regarding The Case of the Rainy-Day Plot Stage** if you're playing above the 52fps range so I had to replaced the previous 60FPS + Uncap FPS mods. 

**THAT'S WHY ONLY 60FPS + UNCAP FPS MODS HAVE A CHEAT FOLDER INCLUDED. THIS IS TO DROP THE FPS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND FIX THE ISSUE** 

If you downloaded them, please replace them. [HERE IS A VIDEO ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE](https://youtu.be/7v0XRf6j-8s?si=0Vdmla8BQeEfz0NK)

>[!CAUTION]
**4K Mod is not working properly on Ryujinx, so it's better to use 2K Mod instead.**

**This is not a problem caused by the mod**. It's a Ryujinx issue. 

Ryujinx has issues with 4K Mods making the perfomance really bad (crashes, freezes, slowdowns, fps drops ...).

The only fix for now it's that if you have enough knowledge to build Ryujinx, do a custom build for yourself and increase the texture cache total size limit.

[Here's the PR + info](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/pull/6471#issue-2182256298) about the texture cache total size limit.

## Instructions on how to download the files

>[!TIP]
Unlike using Control U/F1 or just disabling Vsync, these mods fix cutscenes locked at 24fps and allows you to play the game at 30/60/Uncap FPS with cutscenes fix included.

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .zip file 

>[!CAUTION]
**If you're going to use 60FPS or Uncap FPS mods, read carefully the instructions inside 60FPS/Uncap FPS folder**

2. Now open your emulator (I suggest use Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location for Yuzu or clones/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).

3. Paste the .zip file that you downloaded previously in this directory.

4. Extract the zip file into this directory.

5. Check that you have a folder named [60FPS v.1.0.0] for example and check that this folder contains more folders inside.

Also, don't forget to enable the necessary options that have been indicated in the corresponding mods folders.

Finally your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
