>[!CAUTION]
This is my personal settings and you should not use it as is, as my PC is totally different from yours and you may have a worse performance.

To Download it, click on the .zip file and then click on View Raw.

For instance: I'm using a 4K resolution (3840x2160) and maybe your PC is not powerful enough to use this resolution. Sometimes I change it to 1440p (2560x1440) if I don't have a good perfomance.

Same for the FPS, I'm using MaxFramerate set at 60 as well as the ShadowResolution set at 1024 so if you are having problems with this, you should change it.

I also like to have a fairly high camera sensitivity and you may not adapt to it, so I suggest you change it or readapt it to your liking.

You can change the camera speed in the `Gameplay` section. I've mine set on Stick_Vertical_Speed = 1.5 + Stick_Horizontal_Speed = 3.0

>[!IMPORTANT]
Don't change this: EmuScale = 1.0. EmuScale must be set on 1.0.

>[!CAUTION]
Be careful with the MovieFPS setting. My suggestion is leave it as default or you can try [this mod](https://www.reddit.com/user/PixelKiri/comments/14fx47u/totk_interpolated_60fps_cutscenes_v21/) by PixelKiri.

If you don't use PixelKiri's mod and you set MovieFPS at 60fps, the cutscenes/cinematics will speed up and not sync (The audio will be mostly out of sync).

>[!TIP]
I would leave the **Triple Buffer option** ON and only turn it OFF if you are having issues/is not working properly or as expected. **DON'T SET THIS ON** if you're a Switch user.

TripleBuffer ON for some reason is causing issues if you are a Switch user and not an emulator user.

Double buffer means that when the game can't maintain 60 FPS it drops to 30 FPS. 

Triple Buffer helps with this and tries to prevent this from happening.
