### IMPORTANT INFO:

Although the TID is 0100A77018EA0000 (US version) **this mod should work for all regions and updates available** without having to make a specific mod for each region or having to update the mod. 

**DON'T PLAY this game using Vsync OFF/Disabled** in your global settings or using **Control U (Yuzu)/F1 (Ryujinx)**. There is a very rare bug where if your FPS rate exceeds 60 (around 63-65fps), the character starts to make strange movements (as if he was crouching). Also sometimes by moving the camera the problem disappears, but if you move it again and change the position, angle etc etc it happens again. The same happens when you move the character and run.

That's why I'm making this mod other than to avoid using these options.

This is an [example](https://youtu.be/Z_rTJgc9M1Y?si=9jak3RnsfL28-3gV) of what I'm talking about (Around min 0:07). This is [another gameplay](https://youtu.be/3Rqpk08ZtPg?si=s6jN6UOQTAb5DJY-) (Min 10:00) where this issue is happening. 

Finally, I suggest play this game in Yuzu instead of Ryujinx. Although the mod "fixes" this problem, in Ryujinx it still exists (less often than when using Vsync OFF or Control U/F1). I haven't noticed this problem in Yuzu using the mod although I insist: It's not perfect and you may experience it again sometime. I think it's an emulation issue.

The easiest way to test if this happens to you is to stand in an area and aim the camera as down as possible. Wait a few seconds and check if it happens to you. Then press Control U/F1, check that the issue it's happening and turn it off again to check that it's not happening again and that everything is correct.

### Instructions:

1. Click on the 60fps folder. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

### Info for Switch users:

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
