> [!CAUTION]
The info below is **very important**. So pay attention.

**If you're using 1440p Docked on Ryujinx** and you're facing issues (crashes, slowdowns, visual bugs) [ENABLE THIS OPTION](https://i.imgur.com/obn6kG8.png) **(Remember that Resolution Scale must be on Native (720p/1080p)**. Otherwise you're increasing it.

**If you're using 1440p/2160p Docked on Yuzu** and you're facing issues (crashes, slowdowns, visual bugs), change the Memory Layout [like I'm showing here](https://i.imgur.com/pE21ReJ.png) to 6GB/8GB DRAM **(Remember that the Resolution on the Graphics tab must be on 1x (720p/1080p)**. Otherwise you're increasing it. 

**2160p Docked Resolution Mod Option will need 8GB DRAM.**

Just test which option works best for you: 6GB or 8GB DRAM. 

**Don't do this on General Settings. Do this on Custom Settings (Right click on the game -> Properties -> System Tab)**
