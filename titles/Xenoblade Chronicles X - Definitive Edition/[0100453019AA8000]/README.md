## Mods Available

> [!TIP]
Remember to read the `README.txt` file inside the downloaded .zip file. This will save you lot of time.

- **60FPS + 30FPS Cutscenes (WIP)**: 

This mod makes the gameplay run at 60FPS and keeps the cutscenes lock at 30FPS.

> [!WARNING]
To use this mod properly, you must use the cheat inside the `cheats` folder and the .pchtxt file inside `exefs` folder together.

Otherwise, the mod won't work properly. **KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FPS ARE NOT DYNAMIC** so if the FPS are not stable and goes below 60FPS, you'll notice slowdowns.

**Issues reported without the cheat enabled will be automatically ignored.**

- **60FPS + 60FPS Real Time Cutscenes + 30FPS Pre-rendered Cutscenes (WIP)**:

This is mod is called `[60FPS (60-30FPS Cutscenes)]` on the .zip file.

It makes the game run at 60FPS on gameplay, 60FPS on real time cutscenes and 30FPS on pre-rendered cutscenes.

So if you're playing and you saw a cutscene running at 30FPS, that's a pre-rendered cutscene.

- **Resolution Mods**: 1280x800 (for Steamdeck), 1440p, 1800p, 1900p.

> [!NOTE]
You must set the resolution upscaler on 1x. 

1x will leave the default values as we labeled (2560x1440 for instance). Otherwise, you're increasing the resolution. Ex:

```
1x = 1440p.
2x + using 1440p mod at the same will double 1440p resolution (2880p).
``` 

Also: You might need to increase the DRAM on the emulator settings to 6GB, 8GB etc etc. 

**This should be done only if you're having issues with the resolution mods**. However IMO and on my testings, for 1440p it's not neccesary.

> [!TIP]
Native resolution mods are generally more accurate than emulator scaling.

They use the game's native code to render a resolution rather than an emulator's subjective scaling. 

These mods just change the resolution values that are written to memory.

- **Aspect Ratio Mods**: 2580x1080, 3440x1440, 3840x1080

> [!NOTE]
I don't take Aspect Ratio Mods requests

I don't do Aspect Ratio Mods. That's it's up to [Fl4sh](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174)

> [!WARNING]
Ultrawide Mods are using default HUD (will stretch) to avoid some issues with text/icons

- **FOV**: Fov mod will work on both emulators, but you can only use hotkey combos on Citron.

Hotkeys combos are used to change the FOV values in real time.

>  [!WARNING]
Fov mod can cause a few visual glitches, but you can press ZL+dpad up anytime to back to default value

- **Increased Level Of Detail**

- **Camera Speed Fix**: ONLY WORKING ON CITRON FOR NOW.
