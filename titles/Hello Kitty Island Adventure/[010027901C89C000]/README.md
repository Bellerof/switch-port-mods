> [!NOTE]
These mods shouldn't ask for an update and should work on all versions.

Also **I have 0 interest on this game** so **I won't take a look for updates** etc etc.

I've seen a lot of people asking for FPS mods for this game. However IMO it's a ZzZ (boring) game + made for kids.

I only did the mods because **this game has [Denuvo](https://steamdb.info/app/2495100/info/)**

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\60FPS.pchtxt`
