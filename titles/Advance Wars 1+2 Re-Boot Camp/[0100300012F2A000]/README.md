## IMPORTANT INFO BEFORE USING THE MOD

**TitleID**: 0100300012F2A000

This game **runs at 60fps by default.** However the **gameplay is lock at 30fps**

This mod makes the gameplay run at 60fps or Uncap FPS (if you Press Control U on Yuzu/F1 on Ryujinx).

Thanks to [Masagrator](https://github.com/masagrator) (original author) for helping me find the right offset for Switch emulators.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.0.0.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
