- [Asia](https://tinfoil.io/Title/0100F4401940A000)
- [EU](https://tinfoil.io/Title/01004800197F0000)
- [US](https://tinfoil.io/Title/0100149019460000)

Replace the @nsobid numbers + letters on the .pchtxt file with the Build ID's of your region. Grab all numbers + letters until you reach the 0's. In total they are 32 digits. Ex: 2058227F80E9B40C3B51DB95CAF6B206

If Tinfoil doesn't update and doesn't have the latest Build ID: You can extract it using [this method](https://youtu.be/d1XWoEgAgrU) 

You also have a guide about how to port .pchtxt (ExeFS) mods [here](https://github.com/StevensND/ghidra-port-mods-guide) in case you're missing something.

### Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of your corresponding region. After that, click on the 60fps folder. Then click on the .pchtxt file corresponding to the update you are going to use. Finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

### If you're going to use the Resolution Mods:

Just drag the **corresponding resolution** that you want to use into your Yuzu/Ryujinx Mods folder directory. **Don't use all at the same time.**

**Switch Users:** You can convert the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch). As alternative you can also use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) too.
