Alternatively, you can download this mod from [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/486378) or [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/pokemonbdsp/mods/15) 

This game is **one of the few Pokémon games that doesn't speed up** or have issues while you're playing at 60fps. That's why playing at 60fps is possible.

With this mod **you don't have to use Control U on Yuzu or F1 on Ryujinx (more known as Vsync OFF or Vsync Disabled)** to unlock the FPS and then limit it to 60 using the Nvidia/AMD Control Panel or some similar tool or set the limit speed percent to 200 % on Yuzu.

**The mod sets 60fps automatically** (although I also include an Uncap FPS version).

**These mods works on all versions/updates** of the game and it's mainly intended for Yuzu and Ryujinx.

**If you are a Switch user**: You can use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) instead. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5g6HF7LB4).

Also you can convert the mod (.pchtxt file) to .IPS using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) and following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-V6Rs2sm9w)

There are 2 mods: One for 60fps and one for Uncap FPS (this last mod allows you to play above 60fps).

**Don't use the Uncap FPS mod if you're a Switch/Steam Deck user.**

**If you want to cap your FPS to maybe ... 80 FPS: Use Nvidia/AMD Control Panel and cap your FPS.**

>[!NOTE]
Uncap FPS mod might have a "ghosting" effect inside buildings.
