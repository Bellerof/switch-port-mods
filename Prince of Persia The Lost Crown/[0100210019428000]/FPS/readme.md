## Mods Explanation

- **60FPS Cutscenes**: Makes the cutscenes runs at 60fps instead 30fps (The cutscenes runs at 30 by default).

Should work on all updates without the need of updating this mod.

- **120FPS**: Instead of Uncap your FPS and use RivaTurner/Nvidia/AMD Control Panel to cap your FPS at 120, this does the job for you so the game will run at 120fps without using these tools **only on gameplay**. Main screen + menus still run at 60.

Special thanks to [Fl4sh_](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174/Switch-Ultrawide-Mods) for helping me make this mod. This mod will need an update when a new update is released.

- **Uncap FPS**: Makes the gameplay runs at Uncap FPS (like press Control U on Yuzu/F1 on Ryujinx). **However main screen + menus still run at 60**

Should work on all updates without the need of updating this mod.

## 120FPS Mod Instructions

1. Open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
2. Unzip the .zip file into the mod directory.

Your path should be something like this: `120fps\exefs\1.0.2.pchtxt` and you should also have `120fps\exefs\120fps.pchtxt`

## Rest of Instructions

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
