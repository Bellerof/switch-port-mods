**TID: 01003AE01AA76000 (US Version ONLY)**. I don't plan to adapt this mod to other regions at this time.

You may ask: **Why emulate this game when there is a native PC version?**: You are free to play the version that you want. My only goal with this mod was to see if I was able to adapt the mod made only for real hardware to emulation and I did it. I think it's a good progress in my learning.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT**: I'm not the original author of this mod.

**This mod was origanlly made by [Masagrator](https://github.com/masagrator)** and it was **only working in real hardware using his [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) tool**. He has given me **permission to share this mod** working on emulators so again, thanks Masagrator. So ... **if you're a Switch user just use FPSLocker**. Here's a **[video about it](https://youtu.be/0X5g6HF7LB4?si=dYhWqNnGJnOPkEcT)**

By doing some tests I managed to adapt it to emulator as well. So now this game runs at 60fps.

FYI: By default **using Control U in Yuzu or F1 in Ryujinx doesn't unlock 60fps for this game**. Even using the mod you won't go over 60fps, so Uncap FPS doesn't work.

I won't do that mod as it has problems and the startup screen never loads, it stays black.

**You may experience stuttering** but during my tests it was due to the shaders, once the shaders were built the game ran properly.
