### Instructions:

1. Open the 60fps folder.

2. Select the version that you are going to use (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 ...) and open the .pchtxt file.

3. Click on the arrow icon (Download raw file) and download the file.

4. Open Yuzu/Ryujinx and right click on the game, then click on Open Mod Data Location/Open Mods Directory.

5. Create a new folder and name it 60fps. Open that folder and create another folder inside. Name it exefs. Finally drag/move/paste the .pchtxt that you previously downloaded in this folder.

Your path should be something like: `60fps\exefs\1.0.2.pchtxt`

### IMPORTANT INFO (READ IT):

This mod has only been [tested by me](https://youtu.be/UnH7R6UZx_g?si=62jvzZCAzCycb5F6) in the **US version. TID: 01003AE01AA76000**. However it seems like it's [working in other regions too](https://youtu.be/-S-CTU7OL-0?si=7b8e_ZS3Rke1oenS) due to the rest of the regions share the nsobid (BuildID) with the US Version.

You may ask: **Why emulate this game when there is a native PC version?**: You are free to play the version that you want. My only goal with this mod was to see if I was able to adapt the mod made only for real hardware to emulation and I did it. I think it's a good progress in my learning.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT**: I'm not the original author of this mod.

**This mod was origanlly made by [Masagrator](https://github.com/masagrator)** and it was **only working in real hardware using his [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker) tool**. He has given me **permission to share this mod** working on emulators so again, thanks Masagrator. So ... **if you're a Switch user just use FPSLocker**. Here's a **[video about it](https://youtu.be/0X5g6HF7LB4?si=dYhWqNnGJnOPkEcT)**

By doing some tests I managed to adapt it to emulator as well. So now this game runs at 60fps.

FYI: By default **using Control U in Yuzu or F1 in Ryujinx doesn't unlock 60fps for this game**. Even using the mod you won't go over 60fps, so Uncap FPS doesn't work.

I won't do that mod as it has problems and the startup screen never loads, it stays black.

**You may experience stuttering** but during my tests it was due to the shaders, once the shaders were built the game ran properly.
