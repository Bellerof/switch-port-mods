### Issues

The textures  of some levels were not designed for aspect ratios higher than 16:9 so  on aspect ratios such as 16:10, 21:9 etc etc so you'll see that the  textures of the level are not rendered properly (you will see bigger  spaces in comparison). Perhaps I think that editing the level and making  a mod in RomFS format could fix it. If you see more issues, please, let us know.
