## About FPS Drops

The game runs natively at 60FPS on Switch. However the game is using double buffer.

So if you're facing FPS drops and your FPS drops to 30 is due to that. 

If you're playing on Switch you can try to OC it and apply a good OC to stabilize the FPS.

We try to do a mod to stabilize the FPS. However there's no success yet.

## Is the engine the same as Link's Awakening?

Let's say ... **yes and no**. Some of the functions have changed.

Therefore, some mods such as Disable DOF/Blur have had to be redone to fix bugs.

Some "modders" (if you can call them that because **they're not**) have made copy & paste of Link's Awakening mods hoping that everything will work the same but it's not like that.

## Did you test the mods on Switch or emulator?

I have only played it on Switch. However Fl4sh and the rest of the modders in the team have been playing in emulator.

Some of the mods in their early versions were not working as expected/properly, had visual glitches or the game didn't boot.

Thanks to this, we have been able to verify that the mods work properly on Switch and other emulators (Ryujinx in this case).

## Instructions

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be similar to this: `Disable DOF\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt files to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
