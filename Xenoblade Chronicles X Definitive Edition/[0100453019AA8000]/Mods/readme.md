## How to download and install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]

> [!WARNING]
To use the FPS mod properly, you must use the cheat inside the `cheats` folder and the .pchtxt file inside `exefs` folder together.

Otherwise, the mod won't work properly. **KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FPS ARE NOT DYNAMIC** so if the FPS are not stable and goes below 60FPS, you'll notice slowdowns.

**Issues reported without the cheat enabled will be automatically ignored.**

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
