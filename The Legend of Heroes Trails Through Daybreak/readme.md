## If you want to notify me something

You can use the [issues](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/issues) section.

Alternatively you can use the [discussions](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/discussions) section too.

There, you can notify me when a new update has been released and I haven't updated the mod yet.

Finally, you can contact me on any of **my social media** in this [link](https://linktr.ee/stevensmods) and if you want to donate/support me, here's **my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/stevenss)**. I will appreciate it.

## Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of your corresponding region. After that, click on the 60fps folder. 

Then click on the .pchtxt file corresponding to the update that you are going to use. 

Finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).

3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. 

Open this folder and create another folder inside it. 

Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`
