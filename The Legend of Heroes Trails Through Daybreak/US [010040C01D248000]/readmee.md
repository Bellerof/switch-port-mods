These mods are for the **DEMO only**

The official launch of the game is expected on 5 July.

## How to download and install the mods (Emulator users)

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Example: Click on the `60FPS PCHTXT` folder.

2. Click on the `1.0.0.pchtxt` file.

3. Click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.

4. Open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and then click on `Open Mod Data Location` (Yuzu)/`Open Mods Directory` (Ryujinx).

5. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

## How to download and install the mods (Switch users)

First of all, **your Switch must be modified (software or chip) and you need Atmosphere + Hetake + The Homebrew Album App**.

1. To download the mods and use them on Switch, you need to have an .ips file. Otherwise, the mods won't work on Switch.

If there are any mods that are not converted to .ips, please see this [video guide](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=fnCCnbBKIdpiITY1) to know how to convert from .pchtxt to .ips.

2. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use.

Then, download the mods but first check if `IPS` is specified in the folders. If not, you will have to convert it.

3. Extract the files.

4. Paste the extracted files in the next directory of your microSD card:

```
atmosphere/exefs_patches/NAMEOFTHEMODDOWNLOADED
```

Inside the `NAMEOFTHEMODDOWNLOADED` folder you will find the .ips file.

In the `60FPS mod` example, the full path/directory will be:

```
atmosphere/exefs_patches/TLOHTTD 60FPS Demo
```

>[!NOTE]
If you want to reach 60FPS on Switch, **you'll need to OC your Switch**
