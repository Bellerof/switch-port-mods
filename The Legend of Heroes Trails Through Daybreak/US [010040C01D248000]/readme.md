## IMPORTANT INFO

**Game Title: The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak**

**TitleID: 0100E0A01DD20000**

**Game Region**: USA/EU **ONLY**

> [!NOTE]
This game doesn't run at 60FPS by default. **Not even if you use Vsync OFF (Control U on Yuzu/F1 on Ryujinx)**.

Set the limit speed percent to 200 % or higher **doesn't work either.**

So ... to be able to play at 60FPS, **you need this mod**.

Unfortunately I haven't found a way to make the game run at higher FPS yet.

## Versions compatible:

**1.0.1 | BuildID: 43D0D0D68A22E370

## Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and `Open Mod Data Location` (Yuzu)/`Open Mods Directory` (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

I will upload the .ips file as soon as possible.
