## IMPORTANT INFO BEFORE USING THE MOD

**TitleID**: 0100CB9018F5A000

This game has a **visual bug issue** when playing above or below the 30FPS rate. 

It's not a game breaking issue but if you play on Uncap FPS (around 100FPS and higher) it can become a game breaking due to you don't see the text appearing properly. 

**That's why I'm not releasing an Uncap FPS version** until I fix this issue.

The visual bug appears in the texts indicating objects/characters and always depends on the position and angle of the camera so you may or may not notice it.

[Here's a video demonstration using the Uncap FPS](https://streamable.com/he6izw) and increasing the FPS Limit by 5 until I reach 100FPS.

Keep that in mind before reporting this issue or any other complaint related to this.

I don't know if there are any other problems as I haven't played the game that much (I want to fix this bug ...).

## COMPARISON VS REAL HARDWARE AT 30FPS

You may think the game is speed up at 60fps but I've been comparing the game vs 30fps on real hardware and the game speed is correct IMO. 

I haven't noticed any other problems except for the visual bug with the texts.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\60fps.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
