## Game Info

**Title: Mario & Luigi: Brothership**

**TitleID: 01006D0017F7A000**

**Engine: Unreal Engine 4**

**[Gameplay (Played on Switch with OC), not emulated](https://youtu.be/r2uZrkJb74c?si=dSs0Vmc5ndYlSYw3)**

> [!WARNING]
Tested on Yuzu and Sudachi. **RYUJINX HAS ISSUES AND THE GAME CRASH AFTER 3-5 MINUTES EVEN WITHOUT MODS**.

> [!TIP]
There's a "fix" for Ryujinx but that will drop your FPS so it's up to you use it or NOT

Go to `Options` and then click on `Settings`. Then click on `CPU`. Finally change the `Memory Manager Mode` to `Software`

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

Here is a [video guide](https://youtu.be/0X5g6HF7LB4?si=n-UtFAEAj2VtjEQQ) + [written guide](https://rentry.co/NSwitch60FPSLockerGuide) about FPSLocker

Here is a [written guide](https://rentry.co/howtoget60fps) about how to get 60FPS on Switch.

I uploaded some mods on IPS format too so you don't have to convert them.

## OLED Switch (Mariko) FPS Test

> [!NOTE]
My OC settings are on the gameplay video. However I higly suggest don't do copy & paste.

- 60FPS Only with Default Resolution (1600x900) = 45-50FPS in game. Reaching 60FPS on battles.

- 60FPS + 1080p Mod without OC =  32-35FPS. Reaching 45-60 on battle.

- 60FPS + 1080p Mod + LOD Mod with OC = Watch the gameplay video
