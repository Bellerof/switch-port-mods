Rest of mods will be upload on [Fl4sh's GitHub](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174/Switch-Ultrawide-Mods) and his [GameBanana profile](https://gamebanana.com/members/3083977) as well as [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/20511)

## Emulator Instructions

1. Open the folder of the game that you want to play (Sonic or Shadow).

2. Click on the .zip file of the update that you're using and download it.

Ex: If I have the 1.0.1 I'd download the 1.0.1 .zip file by clicking on the file and after that clicking on `View Raw`.

3. Open the Mods Directory folder of the emulator that you're using. You'll see that **you might have only 1 folder**.

This folder name will be `01005EA01C0FC000`

Keep in mind that if you want to have the other game too, you must create a new folder with the new TitleID. In this case: `01005EA01C0FC000`

In case of Ryujinx my path should be something like: `mods\contents\01005ea01c0fc000\60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt` for Shadow.

For Sonic: `mods\contents\01005ea01c0fc001\60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

Paste/Drag the 60FPS folder inside these folders.

4. Check if the mod is enabled or disabled and that should be all.

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt files to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

Anyway I'm sharing the .IPS files that I created if you want them too.

Keep in mind that for a more stable FPS experience you'd need to OC (overclock) your Switch.
